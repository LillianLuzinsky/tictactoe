Link:   https://lillianluzinsky.github.io/tictactoe/

Description:
This is very similar to the common tic tac toe but instead of using circles and crosses as tokens, you use svg food icons as tokens. 

There are only 10 different icons for this game and there's a max of 5 games to be played. 
Each player is assigned 5 icons each, 1 icon per game. 

Each game also has a food theme:    game 1 (veggies);
                                    game 2 (animal products);
                                    game 3 (meats);
                                    game 4 (fruit);
                                    game 5 (lollies);

Each time you win a game, you go to the next game with 2 new food icons provided, until all 5 games have been played and won.
